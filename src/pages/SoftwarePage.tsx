          I began by asking GPT about consciousness. I wrote my way through cosmology, brought that
          practice into Six Sigma and manufacturing, and taught myself software by turning questions into
          working systems. I came to software the way I came to everything else: willing to begin average,
          repeat the work, and earn the skill. I write the direction, orchestrate the implementation, review
          the result, and carry the system into use.
