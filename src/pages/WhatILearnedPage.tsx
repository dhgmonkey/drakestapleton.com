    title: "People gave me a reason to stay.",
    experience:
      "At nineteen, an invitation through a headset gave me belonging at the exact moment I needed it. Leadership later gave me a way to pass that gift forward.",
    lesson:
      "I built training, schedules, dashboards, and leadership paths that helped members see their ability, support each other, and carry the community forward.",
  },
  {
    when: "MobHub / Production",
    title: "Production taught me to make every path explicit.",
    experience:
      "The live service used systemd while an older Docker path still existed. Remote SSH found a different Node runtime. Standalone builds needed an explicit static asset step.",
    lesson:
      "Each lesson became a deployment rule: one service owner, an explicit runtime path, a deliberate artifact copy, migration gates, backoff, and health checks.",
  },
  {
    when: "Defiant / Production",
    title: "Security controls made the application stronger.",
    experience:
      "Inherited file permissions, content-security policy, redirects, and a database safety setting interrupted real flows at different points. One release returned to its prior version.",
    lesson:
      "I treated every control as a useful signal. I repaired the permissions, policies, and migration state, then verified the recovery before moving forward.",
  },
  {
    when: "Independent AI / Model training",
    title: "Model training gave me two deeper loader lessons.",
    experience:
      "A personal Devstral adapter trained on an H100. The first merge exposed Float8 promotion behavior. The second showed how the model configuration differed from the generic loader.",
    lesson:
      "I repaired the source and brought private inference live through the adapter path.",
  },
  {
    when: "Independent AI / Evaluation",
    title: "A score of 90 invited a closer look.",
    experience:
      "A synthetic fixture scored 90 out of 100 because the evaluator rewarded the shape of a convincing answer more than the source behind it.",
    lesson:
      "I repaired the method. The score became 58, with a human score of 54. The lower number gave me a truer picture of the system.",
  },
  {
    when: "Personal / The harder lesson",
    title: "I learned that survival also means protecting myself.",
    experience:
      "For years, I survived by outworking every limit and carrying more than people saw. That strength built my life, and at one point I carried the work past my body’s limits.",
    lesson:
      "Perseverance now means returning with my health, judgment, and sense of self intact.",
