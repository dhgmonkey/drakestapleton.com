Gina became one of the best mentors I have ever had.",

              I have spent my life competing, doing my best, and watching the result land short of what I
              wanted. The first lesson was painful and simple: effort gives me a chance rather than a promise.
              I could prepare, care deeply, and still miss the job, the recognition, or the test.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jobs passed me over. People called me too young. Recognition and compensation sometimes moved
              more slowly than the value I knew I was creating. Each hit forced me to decide whether the result
              would become a verdict or information. I chose information: study what happened, keep what
              worked, change what failed, and return.
            </p>
            <p>
              The farm taught me to finish the work in front of me. Football taught me to get up after contact.
              Chemistry taught me that an unsuccessful experiment still narrows the answer. Manufacturing
              taught me to turn a problem into a process. Software and AI taught me to preserve every lesson so
              the next attempt begins farther ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
              Persistence for me is disciplined return: the same purpose with better preparation, sharper
              questions, and a stronger system. I enjoy the work, I need the purpose, and each attempt gives
              the next one more to stand on.
