            <h3>I learned to disappear before I learned why.</h3>
            <p>
              I grew up gay in Tennessee, in the Bible Belt. Mom fought for me. Granny and Papa rooted me.
              Dad chose me and gave me his name. My little sister gave me someone to protect. I was surrounded
              by love while believing that being fully known could cost me{\"\\u00a0\"}everything.
            </p>
            <p>
              Disappearing meant studying every room before I entered it. I learned how to stand, talk, and
              laugh like the kind of boy the other boys would let stand near them. I joined the football team,
              fought for my place in honors classes, and practiced looking certain while carrying a truth I
              had barely learned how to name.
            </p>
            <p>
              That kind of hiding creates a particular loneliness. I had a family who loved me and still felt
              unseen, because they could reach only the version I allowed into the room. The more their love
              mattered, the more I feared losing it. I became capable, observant, and self-reliant, writing a
              private manual for how to belong before I understood that belonging should include the whole of
              me.

            <h3>I was average. I wanted excellence.</h3>
            <p>
              I watched intelligence and athleticism seem natural in other people. I played football and sat
              in honors classes feeling pretty average. Autism and ADHD made focus a daily contest, and I
              moved through high school{\"\\u00a0\"}unmedicated.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believed I had to outwork everyone. I returned to the rep, the page, and the problem as many
              times as it took. That habit earned a 3.92, carried me through two science degrees, and became
              the way I enter every new field. The fight made me a survivor.

              I was 24 and Devin was 22, still kids ourselves, when we married in October 2018. By December,
              before our first Christmas as husbands, our first foster placement was home with us. From
              December 2018 until COVID made us stop in spring 2020, we cared for six foster children. All
              six were Level 5 placements, young people the system struggled to place with families prepared
              for that responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              My stepdad adopted my brother and me and became our dad. He chose us, on paper and in every other
              way. I also had Mom beside me through the hardest parts of growing up. Devin and I wanted to offer
              that same presence to young people carrying more uncertainty. When COVID closed the world down,
              the placements ended. The love and the grief both stayed with us.

            <p>
              Dad made official what he had already lived: he adopted my brother and me. Our family calls
              that date Ballentine Day. I became Michael Drake Ballentine and carried Dad's name for eleven
              years. When Devin and I married in 2018, I became Michael Drake Stapleton. Ballentine marks the
              father who chose me. Stapleton marks the life Devin and I chose together.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Dad's birthday in 2024, I received the offer that brought me to 3M as a manufacturing
              engineer. Two years later, on February 13, 2026, another call offered me the product engineer
              role I hold today. The dates have ordinary explanations. They still carry extraordinary
              meaning for me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe Dad has stayed with me as a guardian angel. I miss him, I am grateful for every lesson
              he put into me, and I still want to make him proud. I think he would want me to feel proud of
              myself too.

              Its origin is personal. Dad left handwritten sermons and years of thought behind. I
