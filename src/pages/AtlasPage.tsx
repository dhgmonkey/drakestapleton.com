            The earliest AI conversation I can still document is from February 5, 2023. I was asking about
            quantum communication across space. Two weeks later I was building a numerical model of the
            Sun and Earth. Then came black holes, gravitational waves, consciousness, identity, uploaded
            minds, simulated realities, and recursive worlds.

          <blockquote>What happens when a system becomes capable of modeling itself?</blockquote>
          <p>
            Years later, I can see the line running through every question. Atlas grew from asking what
            continuity means, what makes a self, and how a system can tell which parts of its own story are
            real.

            Dad was a preacher. His writing holds years of his thinking in his own hand. I want to
            scan those pages, preserve the originals, study the patterns in his language, and build a way
            to ask the questions I still carry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dad gave me the Ballentine name, taught me to work, and showed me how to make myself useful. I
            miss him deeply. I am grateful for what he put into me, and I believe he has stayed close as a

            A system made from records is a reconstruction. Its value comes from a careful encounter with
            the trace a person left behind, with every source kept visible and every inference named for

          <p>
            Atlas is designed as a persistent, self-directed digital counterpart. I establish its purpose
            and real-world boundaries. Inside those boundaries, the system develops methods, tools,
            language, and architecture through exploration guided by the purpose of the work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interface is a window into the system. Identity, state, knowledge, custom weights, authority, and
            evidence live in separate parts of the system so each claim stays tied to the source that
            supports it.

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Constraint:</strong> GPU pods incur per-minute billing. The Pi control plane initiates billing only upon verified intent.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Decision:</strong> I implemented a hub-and-spoke architecture. The Pi CLI treats GPU pod status, health, and metadata as read-only probes, explicitly decoupled from the lifecycle `up` command.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Outcome:</strong> This separation ensures deterministic billing control. The system supports reliable pod management on resource-constrained hardware with industrial stability.
